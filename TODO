* Use a config file as an alternative to cli parameters.

* Documentation

* "Scripts", with multiple items set at different times and rates.
   Note: separate from config file containing configuration parameters.

* Scripts including single-setting of items.
   e.g., "ramp value A from 0 to 100 over 60 seconds, and set value B to
   100 30 seconds in."

* MQTT backend
   Will still need to use REST to get current value.  (Maybe require
   explicit starting points if using MQTT.)

* Options for "increase only" or "decrease only".
   For when, say, you want to brighten a lamp from wherever it is to 75%,
   but only if it's currently dimmer than 80%.
