* Set an item gradually.
   
* Use a config file as an alternative to cli parameters.

* "Scripts", with multiple items set at different times and rates.

* Scripts including single-setting of items.
   e.g., "ramp value A from 0 to 100 over 60 seconds, and set value B to
   100 30 seconds in."

* MQTT backend
   Will still need to use REST to get current value.  (Maybe require
   explicit starting points if using MQTT.)
