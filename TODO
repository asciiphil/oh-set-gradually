* Monitor an item to in a sophisticated way determine whether to continue.
   Maybe allow a threshold?  Rather than "item == value", stop if "item <
   value" or "item > value".

* Documentation

* MQTT backend
   Will need separate configuration for getting and setting values.
   Missing sides will fall back to REST.  Will need to complain if we need
   a starting value and can't get one (e.g. because there were no retained
   messages for that item on the MQTT broker).

* Options for "increase only" or "decrease only".
   For when, say, you want to brighten a lamp from wherever it is to 75%,
   but only if it's currently dimmer than 80%.
